PROBLEM 1: Make API with lots of bugs work

BUG 1:
LINE 21
Should be req.query, not req.params

BUG 2:
Line 42
getProtectedCompanies is async, we should await

BUG 3: The users should be sorted by Name, but they are sorted by id instead.
LINE 54
We pass users to getAdminUser. Inside getAdminUser, we have a sort function which mutates the original array.
Moreover, array are passed by reference and not value. So, the original array <users> is being modified.

BUG 4: 
Line 75
If response?.affectedRows === 0, we should insert a row not respond with status 500




PROBLEM 2:
2 APIs
First one INSERTs a row.
Second one UPDATEs the row created in the first API.
Problem: There are occasions where the second is API is hit too early, and API number 1 has not inserted the row yet.
How would you resolve this issue? 
Possible solution: QUEUEING




PROBLEM 3:
1. Describe the JavaScript event loop.
How does it handle asynchronous operations such as promises, setTimeout, and async/await?

2. How would are variables passed in JavaScript? Are they passed by value or by reference? Expound.

3. Describe how the value of this is determined in JavaScript.

The value of this depends on the context in which a function is called:

Global Context / Function Calls: this refers to the global object (or undefined in strict mode).
Method Calls: this refers to the object on which t he method was called.
Arrow Functions: this is lexically bound, meaning it uses this from the surrounding code.
Event Handlers: this refers to the element that received the event.

Describe the stages, technologies, and tools you would use.

2. How would you design a CI/CD pipeline for deploying updates to the online application?
Describe the stages, technologies, and tools you would use.

3. How would you implement monitoring and handle rollbacks in your CI/CD pipeline for the online application?
Describe the stages, technologies, and tools you would use.

4. How do you approach monitoring and logging?
What tools and practices do you use to ensure system reliability and performance?
Describe the stages, technologies, and tools you would use.
