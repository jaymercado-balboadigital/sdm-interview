PROBLEM 1: Make API with lots of bugs work

BUG 1:
LINE 21
Should be req.query, not req.params

BUG 2:
Line 42
getProtectedCompanies is async, we should await

BUG 3: The users should be sorted by Name, but they are sorted by id instead.
LINE 54
We pass users to getAdminUser. Inside getAdminUser, we have a sort function which mutates the original array.
Moreover, array are passed by reference and not value. So, the original array <users> is being modified.

BUG 4: 
Line 75
If response?.affectedRows === 0, we should insert a row not respond with status 500


PROBLEM 2:
2 APIs
First one INSERTs a row.
Second one UPDATEs the row created in the first API.
Problem: There are occasions where the second is API is hit too early, and API number 1 has not inserted the row yet.
How would you resolve this issue? 
Possible solution: QUEUEING

PROBLEM 2: algorithm
