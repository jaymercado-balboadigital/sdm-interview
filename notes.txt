Notes:

Has not coded for the past 2 years. only admin stuff

PROBLEM 1: Make API with lots of bugs work

BUG 1:
Line 75
If response?.affectedRows === 0, we should insert a row not respond with status 500

BUG 2:
LINE 21
Should be req.query, not req.params
Took 10 minutes to troubleshoot.
Had to go through the whole request object to find that programID is inside query instead of params

BUG 3:
Line 42
getProtectedCompanies is async, we should await
Candidate correctly determined that getProtectedCompanies returns a Promise and that it is not resolving.
Unfortunately, he did not know that we have to use await.

BUG 4: The users should be sorted by Name, but they are sorted by id instead.
LINE 54
We pass users to getAdminUser. Inside getAdminUser, we have a sort function which mutates the original array.
Moreover, array are passed by reference and not value. So, the original array <users> is being modified.

PROBLEM 2:
2 APIs
First one INSERTs a row.
Second one UPDATEs the row created in the first API.
Problem: There are occasions where the second is API is hit too early, and API number 1 has not inserted the row yet.
How would you resolve this issue? 
Possible solution: QUEUEING

PROBLEM 2: Leet code
