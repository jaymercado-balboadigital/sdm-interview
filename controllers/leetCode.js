/**
        The challenge is to implement a queue using two stacks.
        The queue should support the standard operations: enqueue, dequeue, peek, and empty.
      // Initialize two stacks. One stack will be used for enqueuing operations, and the other for dequeuing.
      // Enqueue operation will push the element to the first stack.
      // Dequeue operation will check if the second stack is empty.
      // If it is empty, all elements from the first stack are popped and pushed into the second stack, effectively reversing their order.
      // Then, the top element of the second stack is popped.
      // Peek operation is similar to dequeue but returns the element without removing it.
      // Empty operation checks if both stacks are empty.

    enqueue: function (x) {},
    dequeue: function () {},
